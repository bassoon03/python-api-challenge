Some of the code in this file may be borrowed from Saturn Cloud. I used several other websites for reference, such as the Pandas website, MatPlotLib, maybe geeksforgeeks, maybe w3schools.
There are two files, WeatherPy and VacationPy. There is also a file to contain the api keys, but these cannot be seen since they are hidden by a .gitignore file. The WeatherPy file also contains analyses for each
of the linear regression plots, directly below each plot.
